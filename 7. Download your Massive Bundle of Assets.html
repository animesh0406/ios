But it's exactly what you need when you start creating your own apps. The best part about this course is being able to create your own apps after the course, so we got our designer to make this massive bundle of image assets worth over $5000 that you can download and use for all your future app building projects!</p><p>To download the assets, just click on the arrow on the top-right corner of the screen, it should say "Course Content" and you should find a link to the downloads. </p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-11-25_13-17-20-01145e09d823a565ab86e3e42342febd.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-11-25_13-18-04-d9c013382b27a28b3bb2f40cc1a676cc.png"></figure><p>Sometimes, Udemy has issues rendering the downloadable assets, in which case you can log out and log back in to Udemy and try again.</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>Your instructor, Angela</p>
